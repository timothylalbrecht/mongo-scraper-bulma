![DashBored Logo](https://i.imgur.com/SmsHwTp.png "DashBored")

A web application that scrapes the BBC homepage of all articles, and populates a minimal new page with said info. Users are then able to click on individual articles, and leave notes on the articles with persistence. Technologies used include:

* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Express
* Bulma.io
* HTML

A deployed version can be found on heroku:

## Next Steps

Another repo which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/timothylalbrecht/mongo-scraper), includes another version of this app that utilizes handlebars instead of a static html page and bulma. Im currently having a linking issue with my application javascript, and hope to take some time to correct those issues, at it will be more robust than the current iteration.

## So... why this one?

In short, I wanted a deployed repo for this project. So this project turned into a lesson in Bulma, which is pretty AWESOME. IM definitely going to dig into it further. Though I did find some potential shortcomings when having to concatenate in some style data.
